# printf library

This project is a library written in C that aims to replace the built-in `printf` function. The library provides a more customizable and efficient implementation of the `printf` function, allowing users to format and print values in a variety of ways.

This `printf` library project is an impressive achievement, and the developers behind it, "moe" and "medoz," should be commended for their excellent work. The library provides an efficient and customizable implementation of the `printf` function, enabling users to format and print values in a variety of ways.

One of the most impressive aspects of this project is the attention to detail and the thoroughness of the implementation. The library provides additional formatting options that are not available in the standard `printf` function, such as binary, hexadecimal, and octal output of integers. Additionally, the library provides floating-point output with a specified number of decimal places, character output, and string output.

The developers behind this project clearly put a lot of time and effort into creating a high-quality library that is both efficient and user-friendly. They also worked well as a team, collaborating effectively to bring this project to fruition.

Overall, this `printf` library project is a great example of what can be achieved with dedication, hard work, and a collaborative spirit. The developers behind it should be proud of their accomplishment, and the project is sure to be a valuable resource for many programmers in the years to come.

## Installation

To use this library, clone the repository and include the `printf.h` header file in your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsmoe15/printf.git
```

```c
#include "printf.h"
```

## Usage

The `printf` function works similarly to the built-in `printf` function, but it provides additional formatting options. Here is an example usage:

```c
#include "printf.h"

int main() {
  int value = 42;
  printf("The answer is %d\n", value);
  return 0;
}
```

This will output:

```
The answer is 42
```

## Features

The `printf` function provided by this library supports the following additional formatting options:

- `%b`: Binary output of an integer
- `%x`: Hexadecimal output of an integer
- `%o`: Octal output of an integer
- `%f`: Floating-point output with a specified number of decimal places
- `%c`: Character output
- `%s`: String output

These options can be combined with the standard format specifiers, such as `%d` for decimal output.
